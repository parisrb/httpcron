= httpcron is a ruby application to cron http requests

* administration can be done using a REST API or a webapp
* http requests use asyncronous IO enabling a very low resource usage
* storage use sequel[http://sequel.rubyforge.org/] so most of popular SQL database are supported

= Causes:

- existing http cron capabilities of hosting providers are very limited
- existing classic schedulers are not adapted to http requests and/or lack an admin part

= Installation

- install the bundler gem if you donâ€™t have it (+gem install bundler+)

- in the app directory run +rackup+
